\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces For larger impact angles that are more grazing to the surface, the zenith and azimuth ejecta distributions become asymmetric. Starting at $70^\circ $, the peak ejecta angle $\alpha _{max}$ becomes negative in an exclusion range, as shown in the figure. This means that the $-\alpha _{max}\to \alpha _{max}$ and $\beta -\beta _i\to \beta -\beta _i +\pi $. In this model, for impact angles near $90^\circ $, most of the ejecta is concentrated in the downstream direction.\relax }}{7}{figure.caption.2}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces The color gradient shows the distance a projectile goes with a given ejected speed and zenith angle. The cyan dashed line gives the optimal angle for a given speed to reach the furthest distance, i.e., Eq.\ \textup {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \normalfont (\ignorespaces \ref {eq:opt_angle}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}}. The red dashed line shows for which pairs of speeds and zenith angles are required to hit the antipodal point. As an example, all ejecta with speed and angle pairs between the two black curves will reach a location between 0.05 and 0.06 lunar circumference units away, using Eq.\nobreakspace {}\textup {\hbox {\mathsurround \z@ \normalfont (\ignorespaces \ref {eq:speed_asof_distance_angle}\unskip \@@italiccorr )}}.\relax }}{14}{figure.caption.6}%
